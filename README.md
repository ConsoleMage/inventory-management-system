To complete this challenge, you will need to create a console application where users can manage product stock. Users should be able to add new products, update stock, and remove products.

Some key features include:

- Add new products with name, price, and stock quantity.

- Update stock when products are sold or restocked.

- View all products and their stock levels.

- Remove products from inventory.

### 2. Control Structures

If-else was used to validate data provided from user input.

Switch case was used to direct the flow of the application.

### 3. Loops

I used a while loop to start the program, ensuring the program exits only on user input. Any input provided by the user will trigger a method call.

### 4. Copilot

I was extremely blown away by AI's capabilities to review and comment on code. It has helped tremendously with making my application much more robust, and concise. I learnt how to question Copilot's review and comments of my code in the Visual Studio IDE, reviewing them line by line and to keep/undo Copilot's changes. The highlighted red/green text made the task much more pleasant to deal with.
