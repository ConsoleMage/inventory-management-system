To complete this challenge, you will need to create a console application where users can manage product stock. Users should be able to add new products, update stock, and remove products.

Some key features include:

- Add new products with name, price, and stock quantity.

- Update stock when products are sold or restocked.

- View all products and their stock levels.

- Remove products from inventory.


### 2. Control Structures (if...else/switch)

- if...else was used to validate data provided from user input.

- switch case was used to direct the flow of the application.

### 3. Control Structures (while/foreach)

I used a while loop to start the program, ensuring the program exits only on user input. Any input provided by the user will trigger a method call.


### 4. Copilot

I was truly amazed by AI's ability to review and provide feedback on code. It has been invaluable in making my application more robust and concise. I learned how to critically evaluate Copilotâ€™s suggestions in Visual Studio IDE, reviewing them line by line and deciding whether to keep or undo its changes. The red and green highlights made the review process much smoother and more enjoyable.
